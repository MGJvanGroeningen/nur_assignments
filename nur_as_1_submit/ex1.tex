\section{Cooling rates in cosmological simulations}

The shared module for this exercise

\subsection{1a}

We plot the interpolated normalized net cooling rate as function of temperature.

The result of the script is the following plot.

\newpage

\subsection{1b}

This code makes plots of the normalized net cooling rate at 50\% solar metallicity and hydrogen density $n_{H}$ = 0.0001 $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ for 101 evenly spaced redshift values between 0 and 8.989. These plots are put in a directory called 'plots1b'. A movie from these plots is created in the terminal with filename 'coolratemovie.mp4'.
